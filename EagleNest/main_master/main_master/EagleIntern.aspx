                    <p>Senior | Computer Science | Ralph Lauren | Brand Planning Intern | Manhattan, New York</p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        I found out about the Brand Planning Intern through a job search platform called WayUp.com. 
                After thoroughly reading through every requirement for the internship position, knew that the internship 
                position was a perfect fit and phenomenal opportunity to gain hard skills in data analytics, BI tools, and 
                learning soft skills in the corporate world.
                <br />
                        <br />
                        During my time at Ralph Lauren, I had the opportunity to learn and use cutting edge technology in data analytics such as 
                MicroStrategy and Edited. I also worked on big data projects that significantly improved my Excel, VBA, critical-thinking, 
                analytical, and detail-orientated skills. I also had an opportunity to work on my confidence and presentation skills by presenting
                my insightful findings to the merchandising and brand teams. 
                <br />
                        <br />
                        In addition, I had the amazing opportunity to network, and foster new relationships that I will have for life. At Ralph Lauren, I
                was valued, my work my impactful, I discovered a part of myself I never knew existed.
